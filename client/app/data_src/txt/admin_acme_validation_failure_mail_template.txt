Dear {RecipientName},

GlobaLeak's is configured to use Let's Encrypt to provide HTTPS support for your instance.
Unfortunately, the last attempt to renew the certificate ran into a validation error which
suggests that your setup or domain name may have changed.

Expiration date: {ExpirationDate}

Without a valid certificate, the platform will be accessible in a secure way only via Tor.

Log in to issue new certificates.

via Tor at: {TorUrl}
via HTTPS at: {HTTPSUrl}

Kind regards,
{NodeName}
