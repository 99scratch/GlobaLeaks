Dear {RecipientName},

The automatic HTTPS certificate renewal scheduled for today just failed.

The system will keep retrying.

Expiration date: {ExpirationDate}

Without a valid certificate, the platform will be accessible in a secure way only via Tor.

via Tor at: {TorUrl}
via HTTPS at: {HTTPSUrl}

Kind regards,
{NodeName}
